Hi there,

welcome to my AI playground. ðŸ‘‹

I'm Max and I'm a full stack web developer.
I've been a freelancer for more than 7 years and mostly use the TALL stack in my projects. I started out as a frontend engineer, using Foundation and Bootstrap. I always enjoyed working with the latest JS frameworks and started out using good old jQuery. I have experience using React.js, Angular, Vue.js and plenty of other JS frameworks.

Currently, I enjoy working with Tailwind CSS and Laravel. I also often use Livewire and Alpine.js.

Join me on my journey to becoming a content creator who experiments with cutting edge AI technology. I like the practical side of things, so you'll see bits of code here and there and less theory.
